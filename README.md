# RS2-Definition-Suite
Using CEBL, RS2 Definition Suite is a cache suite that will allow the operator to read, modify, and create new definitions for RS2 cached configs. This suite will allow the operator to export config data, so it may be packed using another cache suite such as Tom's Cache Suite.
